Welcome to a my latest mini-project: A weekly mixtape of things I found pretty awesome in my weekly listening queue. Here you'll find good jams, musical tidbits, and generally a better sound to your day. I hope to also be able to recruit other listeners to contribute to their stash of good music to this list, so stay tuned!

The goal of the playlists published will be at least an hour's worth of music, with the intentions of helping you discover artists and albums you might otherwise have missed. I'll select some of my favorites off of given albums but definitely queue up the rest of the albums listed to discover more awesome beyond this very abbreviated list.

To start us off, our first edition of Are You Listening is this playlist (Spotify). We just got past all the holiday music so we can finally get back to the good stuff. Just to note, while I'm not a big fan of Spotify, it will be where the majority of my playlists are hosted. Not ideal, but it works for now. The goal is to ensure you have a way to listen to all of the music listed with as few barriers as possible. SoundCloud will probably also show up from time to time.

And as a special treat, while I'm sure many of you saw Radiohead posted about being asked to write the opening theme for Spectre, the latest Bond film. The result is pretty spectactular, even more so when paired with the opening credit roll to the movie. Allow me:
