This week I hit a bit of a bump in two albums, and they pretty much dominated my listening this past week. So instead of a playlist, you get two albums to spin through.

The first is The Dø and their latest album, Shake, Shook, Shaken. It's a pretty fantastic mix of songs that range from almost Gorillaz-esque tunes to a more St. Vincent sound. Definitely worth a few listens. The extended, "Unreleased B-Sides" version of the album has a few additional songs which are just as good as the album itself. Check it.

The second one caught me by surprise when I first heard it, mostly because I thought it was somebody else entirely. Andy Shauf, at least initially sounds almost exactly like Elliot Smith, which if you don't know Smith, you might recognize him from the suicide scene in the Royal Tenenbaums, Needle in the Hay:

Anyways, Shauf is fairly dark in subject matter, but extremely easy listening. Obviously a very different genre from  The Dø but I couldn't stop listening to either album this week, so I'm giving them both as the listening for this week's audience. Hope you enjoy.
