After an extended hiatus over general life business (music collection is not my day job &#128521;), the listing is back! I have not forgotten, nor have I not been keeping up with my collections. Posting them sometimes just takes more time than I have. So here are three playlists I've put together in the time I've been gone. Lots of good music to catch up on, hope you enjoy.

## Week of 1.18

## Week of 1.25

## Week of 2.1

Later this week (or next), I have a special 70s playlist I've been working on over time that I hope to share. It's one of my favorite "dance off with the family in the livingroom" playlists ever, so look forward to that.
